# Umphakatsi
A database for constituancies with maps, demographics and bounderies in Eswatini 
Umphakatsi onLine
Thula T Dlamini 
A mobile and web based application for Taking the Kingdom of Eswatini to 2022.

Introduction
The umphakatsi system of governance is based on Mosaic laws found in Deuteronomy. 
There are three basic human rights; Food, Shelter and Clothing. Health, employment, education, sports, entertainment and other human requirements and activities are secondary to the basic needs. 
In order to qualify to be regarded as a developed nation, the Kingdom of Eswatini must, at the very least, meet the three basic needs for the whole population. In order to evaluate and monitor the progress that the nation is making in this regard, the Umphakatsi onLine Application would be the perfect Monitoring and Evaluation tool.
Using Google Maps, the application will be able to amongst other functions perform the following:- 
Umphakatsi
Identify the physical location and bounderies of each Umphakatsi.
Identify and list uptodate Authorities for each Umphakatsi. It will list the:-
Mntfwanenkhosi
Sikhulu
Ndvuna
Bantfwabenkhosi
Bandlancane
Bandlakhulu
Identify the physical location and bounderies of each homestead.
Keep an uptodate record of the population and demographic statistics for each Umphakatsi.
Location and status of Health facilities, service facilities, Educational institutions, business centres etc.
Homesteads
For each Homestead, the application may keep uptodate records pertaining to:-
Head of the homestead (Likhaya)
Emadladla
Demographic statistics on the occupants
Status with regards to water supply, electrification and connectivity to land line telephone and income bracket of the homestead.
Classification of the homestead with regard to its ability to meet the three basic needs.
Population
With  regards to the populance of each Umphakatsi, the application will be able to keep uptodate records pertaining to:-
Status, age, level of education, occupation, land utilization and other demographic data.
Access and Security
The Hierachy and Authority of the country is well defined and respected. Access for the purposes of updating the system will be bases on the rules of the Authoritative Hierachy of our system of governance. For instance  a homestead may only be added by the Authority of the Umphakatsi who would also determine its bounderies.
In the same vein, only the head of a homestead who has been added and verified by the Athority of Umphakatsi may add or remove members of his homestead,
The system would be transparent and open to everyone making it verifiable. Each individual would have their own access code with varying access levels and permissions depending on their status.
Conclusion
With uptodate information, the Government of the Kingdom of Eswatini may be able to:-
Budget for projects from the grassroots
Plan for interventions where they are identified
Monitor the progress and impact of interventions
The data from the different Imiphakatsi may be correllated by Tinkhundla, Regions and the whole country.
The Kingdom of Eswatini is a relatively small country with a relatively small population. As such  the Kingdom is in a position to lead the way with regard to using technology to meet the millenium goals,
Such a system may be used for verifiable polls, public opinions, voting etc.
